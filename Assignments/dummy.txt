Command to convert the ratings (agreement levels) to categorical values 
df$rating <- factor(df$rating, levels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree", "Neutral", "Agree", "Strongly Agree"), ordered = TRUE)

If they're unordered like "Yes", "No", "Maybe", then it'll be
df$response <- factor(df$response)

If they're ordered, like say that agreement levels given numbers, then we'll get
df$rating <- factor(df$rating, levels = 1:5, ordered = TRUE)

If they are numbers, but are categorical values, then use code: 
df$category <- as.factor(df$category)

Softmax in R

softmax <- function(x) {
  exp_x <- exp(x - max(x))  # subtract max(x) for numerical stability
  return(exp_x / sum(exp_x))
}

x <- c(2.0, 1.0, 0.1)
softmax(x) # this will return an array of probabilistic values, for each of the elements in x
